# TodoList
Todolist to practice JS/React/TS

This project will be broken into a few phases to help me learn 
1) Vanilla JS: basic DOM manipulation
2) React: Refactor to create todolist with React. UI design implementation. Possible exploration of Redux as well.
3) TypeScript: Possible refactor to practice using TS with React
